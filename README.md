## 📌 Project Overview

Diabetes is a chronic health condition affecting how your body processes glucose. This machine learning project aims to predict whether a patient is likely to develop diabetes based on clinical features.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Explore and visualize the dataset
- Build classification models like:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Support Vector Machine
  - K-Nearest Neighbors
  - XGBoost / LGBM
- Compare model performance using Accuracy, F1, Recall
- Use confusion matrices and ROC curves for evaluation

---

## 📊 Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn, XGBoost, LightGBM
- Seaborn, Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset is based on the [Pima Indians Diabetes Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database).
